# Complex PRP Framework

A comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development of complex, multi-phase software projects using Claude Code and systematic planning methodologies.

## 🎯 What is Complex PRP Framework?

The Complex Multi-Phase Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) framework transforms large, complex software projects into manageable, systematic development phases with full context continuity and quality assurance.

### Key Benefits

- **🧠 Systematic Planning**: AI-driven analysis of BRD and Architecture documents to generate optimal phase breakdown
- **🔗 Context Continuity**: Each phase understands exactly what was built previously through automated completion summaries
- **⚡ Dynamic Adaptation**: Future phases automatically adapt based on learnings from completed phases
- **🛡️ Risk Mitigation**: Systematic validation prevents integration issues between phases
- **📊 Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation at every development stage
- **📈 Scalability**: Handles projects from medium to enterprise complexity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
- Git for version control
- Your project's Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Your project's Architecture Document

### 1. Set Up Your Project

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone <your-complex-prp-framework-repo>
cd Complex-PRP-Framework

# Use the project generator to create a new project
python tools/project-generator.py --name YourProject --type web-application
```

### 2. Systematic Phase Planning (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ../YourProject

# Generate optimal phase plan from your documents
/plan-project-phases PLANNING/BRD_YourProject.md PLANNING/Architecture_YourProject.md

# This creates:
# ✅ PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md - Master phase plan with timeline
# ✅ PHASE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md - Visual dependency analysis  
# ✅ INITIAL_PHASE1.md, INITIAL_PHASE2.md, etc. - All phase files
# ✅ Optimal sequencing based on requirements analysis
```

### 3. Execute Development Phases

```bash
# For each phase (1, 2, 3, ...):

# Generate comprehensive implementation PRP
/generate-prp INITIAL_PHASE[N].md

# Execute the phase implementation
/execute-prp PRPs/[generated-prp-file].md

# Document what was actually built (automated analysis)
/update-phase-completion [N]

# Adapt future phases based on learnings (automated adaptation)
/update-phase-plans [N]

# Repeat for next phase...
```

## 📋 Framework Components

### Core Templates

## 🎯 When to Use Complex PRP Framework

### Perfect For:
- **Multi-Component Projects**: Frontend, backend, database, integrations
- **Performance-Critical Systems**: Specific latency, throughput, or reliability targets  
- **Complex Integrations**: External APIs, third-party services, multiple data sources
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Security, compliance, audit trails
- **Scalable Applications**: Must support growth and future enhancements

### Example Project Types:
- Trading platforms with real-time data processing
- SaaS applications with complex business logic
